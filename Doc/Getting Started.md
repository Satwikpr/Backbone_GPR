# How to use this application 
This application predicts the beam-column model parameters based on the geometric and material properties of the column.Based on the recommendations provided by Haselton et al. (2016), 14 predictor variables are considered. Models are fitted based on these predictor variables. Many of the predictor variables are derived based on primary sectional properties. So this app provides two options to input variables.

## Option 1: Using Basic Variables 
Users can input primary material and geometric properties. The required parameters are calculated in the back end. However, this option is not available if a user uses MATLAB script. 
## Option 2: Using Derived variables 
A user can directly input required variables as well using this option. 
If a user is using  MATLAB script, input variables should be added to the spreadsheet. For the prediction of Yield Strength, additional variables are needed that can be entered in the spreadsheet.
