# Installation Modes
This package can be executed in three ways.
## MATLAB Script
The folder [Scripts](https://github.com/Satwikpr/Backbone_GPR/tree/main/Script) contains separate GPR Models fitted for each parameter and related files for scaling and centering of the predictor variables. To obtain the required results, the user should only run the Matlab script named driver.m. Input should be given through spreadsheet named [input_data_14_var.xlsx](https://github.com/Satwikpr/Backbone_GPR/blob/17418e4aec081d50feee41ab044da189370b3cff/Script/input_data_14_var.xlsx) and [input_data_for_My.xlsx](https://github.com/Satwikpr/Backbone_GPR/blob/8d4681e62e7a19a2f88fea200b2dbf04926c19a7/Script/input_data_for_My.xlsx). Only derived predictor variables should be included in the spreadsheet (More Info).
