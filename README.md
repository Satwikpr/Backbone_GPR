# Backbone_GPR

This package predicts Reinforced Concrete Parameters based on member’s material and geometric properties based on Gaussian Process Regression as proposed by Rayjada et al.(2022). These parameters include backbone curve parameters encompassing the member’s response under loading and energy dissipation. Lognormal prediction uncertainty estimates can also be obtained.

# Intallation Modes

This package can be exicuted in three ways.

### MATLAB Script

Folder contains saparate GPR Models fitted for each parameters and related files for scaling and centering od the predictor variables. User should only run matlab script named driver.m to obtain the required results. Input should be given through spreadesheet named. Only Derived predictor variables should be included in the spreadsheet (More Info).

### MATLAB Apllication

 is a pakage file that can be imported in MATLAB. It requires MATLAB and necessary toolboxs intstalled in the system. The app appears in the Apps tab in the MATLAB Toolstrip.
 
### MATLAB Standalone Desktop Application 

 use this file if MATLAB is not intalled in the system. However, this MATLAB Runtime must be installed already. To know more.
